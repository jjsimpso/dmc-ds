Dmc-ds is a homebrew game project to port the old DOS game Dungeon Master II to the Nintendo DS.  This is a solo project for now, but I may solicit help from the homebrew community once I have laid a suitable foundation.

Execution of the code will require the user to provide his/her own copies of the dungeon.dat and graphics.dat data files.
